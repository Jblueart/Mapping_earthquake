# Mapping Earthquakes using API's
Branching out the repository 

## HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Use JavaScript and the D3.js library to import the data, then use the Leaflet library to enhance the Mapbox map via api request -for an interactive experience. 

Learning to map features, as points, lines, & with GeoJson data, Polygons, linestrings, points & layering multiple maps. 

## Earthquake Data

Having survived the great Salt Lake City Earthquake in March of 2020 I could use this data to determine where it will be safe to move in order to avoid areas with the most extreme earthquake events. 

Interpreting the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last 7 days using real time information. 
To identify and illustrate the earthquakes, we'll leverage API supplied Data & add popups, color & style sheets to interpret the results. 
Once I get the Data, Style, Color & popups working, I'll create a Legend & ultimately merge the Earthquake Branch into the Main branch to have a polished unified website.
