# Mapping Earthquakes using API's
Branching out the repository 

## HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Use JavaScript and the D3.js library to import the data, then use the Leaflet library to enhance the Mapbox map via api request -for an interactive experience. 

Learning to map features, as points, lines, & with GeoJson data, Polygons, linestrings, points & layering multiple maps. Popups were a struggle, I didn't quite understand them at first, but finally it clicked and I was able to leverage the power of having an array.

## Earthquake Data

Having survived the great Salt Lake City Earthquake in March of 2020 I could use this data to determine where it will be safe to move in order to avoid areas with the most extreme earthquake events. 

### Closeup of my home state of Utah 
Truthfully, I didn't realize those earthquakes had even occured!

Interpreting the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last 7 days using real time information. 
To identify and illustrate the earthquakes, we'll leverage API supplied Data & add popups, color & style sheets to interpret the results. 
Once I get the Data, Style, Color & popups working, I'll create a Legend & ultimately merge the Earthquake Branch into the Main branch to have a polished unified website.
